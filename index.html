        <h2 align="center">these are 10 modules that show what I've learnt</h2>
        <h3 class ="coursename">1 - Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/XswgX9X"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XswgX9X.png" title="source: imgur.com"/></a>
        <p class = "paragraph">This module was by far my favourite. I learned about objects, randomness, movement based on forces and vectors, not only in a computer science mindset, but also real world applications of these ideas. The concepts I learned in this module will help me in my continued studies of computer science/programming but also in my physics and math courses I will take in the future. The module showed me a different way to look at physics and math. I believe that the object oriented mentality I developed in this module helped me to learn and complete assignments this semester, but also will help me in my future computer science and programming endeavors.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">2 - Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/xMsco7m"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xMsco7m.png" title="source: imgur.com"/></a>
        <p>This module mostly taught me the basics of Javascript and gave me a good base to build off during my learning throughout the rest of the semester. In this module I learnt the basic syntax of Javascript, the format that programmers use when writing in Javascript and got a small glimpse of object oriented programming. This module has and will help me throughout my learning because it built my base knowledge of the Javascript language and as long as im using javascript I will use what ive learnt in this module.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">3 - Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/Ox6nnDU"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ox6nnDU.png" title="source: imgur.com"/></a>
        <p>This module taught me the basics of writing in html and taught me the html syntax. It also taught  me how to incorporate styles and design into any website I may like to make. These skills can aid me in my education in the future if I need to design or create a website for personal or professional reasons. The most significant impact this module had on me is  the realization of how much effort it takes to make websites look good and how designing a good looking website takes a lot of time.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">4 - Introduction to the Basic Data Structure</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/yNyOLWY"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yNyOLWY.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
        <p>In this module I learnt how about the different data types in Javascript and how they are implemented. I also learnt how different data types are created. This module will help me in my future endeavors in Javascript because it taught me how to properly use the data types available to me.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">5 - Introduction to the Debugging Challenges</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/gbh5yeM"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gbh5yeM.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
        <p>This module has taught me a lot about how to debug and fix mistakes in my code. Not only can this module help me to fix my mistakes in Javascript, but parts of it can also help me debug problems in other coding languages. I will use what I learnt in this module for the rest of my programming “career” to solve and fix problems in any coding language.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">6 - Introduction to Basic Algorithm Scripting</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/1raGLIT"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1raGLIT.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
        <p>This module taught me about how to write simple precise algorithm in Javascript. This skill can be useful when i'm writing programs that need simple algorithms in them to function. Ialso will take away the ability to decide how to write simple algorithms in any language as long as I continue to pursue programming in my life.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">7 - Introduction to the Regular Expression</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/ApeDdMH"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ApeDdMH.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
        <p>This module taught me how to use the test regex function to check for certain characters, words, numbers, etc in a string. It also taught me different shorthands and symbols in my regex to make searching for the items listed before more easily. I will use what I learnt in this module in the future when writing programs involving strings and searching for letters/numbers in string. The most important thing I learned in this module is that regex exists and is a very useful tool when programming in Javascript, specifically when dealing with strings.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">8 - Introduction to the Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/tHlLAPW"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tHlLAPW.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
        <p>This module taught me the basics of object oriented thinking, and it caused me to start thinking in a more object oriented way once I had completed the module for the simple reason that it is easier. It taught me that I can reuse the same bits of code for similar, yet slightly different objects and also taught me about the concept of inheritance, which I had not yet heard of before completing this module. The most important thing I will take away from this module is my object oriented mentality that i developed because it will be useful in the future when studying computer science and programming.</p>
        <h3 class ="coursename">9 - Introduction to the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting</h3>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/DophsLX"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DophsLX.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
        <p>This module taught me about how to write more complex algorithm in Javascript.when i am writing complex programs I can use this skill to write algorithms that can complete complex and difficult tasks. I also will take away the ability to decide how I should write the complicated algorithms i write in a way that is easy to follow and is not too complicated.</p>
